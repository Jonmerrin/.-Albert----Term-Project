OVERVIEW:
Albert is a game about an Artificial Intelligence learning about the world for the first time. You play
as Albert, named because of how AI looks slightly like the name Al. As you progress in the story the
puzzles become more elaborate, and you become more advanced, eventually adding the capability of seeing
through a rudimentary camera.
In the puzzles you connect Synapses (green circles) through node (not green circles) to form associations
in a way that represents actual learning. Once you've created the associations, you can connect them
into concepts, which can be connected to make a full understanding of an idea. Each puzzle is layered,
and each layer is built off the layer below it.
